This is a small project for use with EGit (eclipse.org/egit). Its purpose is to provide some of the 
git functionality that is currently not implemented in EGit/JGit.

It requires that you have a native version of git installed.

Currently provided operations are:
Stash: git stash
Unstash: git stash apply
Clear Stash: git stash clear
