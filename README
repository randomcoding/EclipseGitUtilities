This is a small project for use with EGit (eclipse.org/egit). Its purpose is to provide some of the 
git functionality that is currently not implemented in EGit/JGit.

It requires the following:
1.  git installed.
2. Setup a Run/Debug variable GIT_EXEC:
 1. Open Window -> Preferences ->Run/Debug -> String Substitution
 2. Select New...
 3. Enter GIT_EXEC in the Name text box
 4. Browse to your git executable for the Value box (mine is /usr/bin/git)
 5. Enter a description, if you like, and then Ok everything.
 
This requirement exists so as to allow git to reside anywhere on your system, with any name and not be tied into the project's configuration.

Currently provided operations are:
Stash: git stash
Unstash: git stash apply
Clear Stash: git stash clear
